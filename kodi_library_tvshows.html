                             <span class="plot" >"Allen Gregory" is an animated series that tells the story of one of the most pretentious 7-year-olds of our time.
When he looks in the mirror, Allen Gregory De Longpre doesn't see a child. He sees a young man who is intelligent, sophisticated, worldly, artistic and romantic—characteristics he inherited from his doting father, Richard.
The pair share an extraordinary father-son bond—a bond that is sometimes annoyingly interrupted by Richard's life partner, Jeremy, for whom Allen Gregory has minimal respect, if any at all.

They live together in a stunning architectural loft, along with Julie, Allen Gregory's adopted Cambodian sister.
Although Allen Gregory has allegedly composed operas, written novels and dated Chloe Sevigny, he's about to embark on his greatest challenge yet: leaving the safety of his father's homeschooling and attending elementary school with children his own age.

His journey will be a struggle, not only with the other kids at school, but with the faculty as well. Whether it's the all-out rivalry with Gina Winthrop, his by-the-book second grade teacher; his unique relationship with Judith Gottlieb, his 68-year-old principal; or his desperate desire to be best friends with Joel Zadak, the school's popular stud, Allen Gregory has his work cut out for him.
With the help of his trusty friend and assistant, Patrick Vanderweel; and the support of Superintendent Stewart Rossmyre, who believes the De Longpres are a tremendous asset to the school, Allen Gregory won't have to get his hands too dirty.

"Allen Gregory" is about an outsider. And while he may put on a tough exterior, deep down, all Allen Gregory wants is to fit in. Well, that, and for Julie to run away and never be seen or heard from again. And Jeremy too.</span> <br />

Much to his chagrin, George recently learned that his ex-girlfriend, Dorothy Crane (JoAnna Garcia Swisher, Better with You), has inherited the family business and is now George's boss. Whip-smart and ambitious, Dorothy shakes up the hospital as she brings order to the chaos and butts heads with George's animal-friendly administration.

Dr. Rizzo, the resident capuchin monkey at Crane Animal Hospital and George's closest companion is played by Crystal (The Hangover II, NBC's Community).</span> <br />

The pressure of blending two families while dealing with resentful, escapist, and strung out children takes a back seat when society begins to break down. A forced evolution, and survival of the fittest takes hold, as our dysfunctional family finds they must either reinvent themselves or embrace their darker histories.</span> <br />

                             <span class="plot" >Little Bill is the story of the Glover family, told through the viewpoint of the youngest son, Bill Glover Jr., affectionately known as Little Bill. Little Bill lives with his mother, Brenda, a photographer, Big Bill, a housing inspector for the city, his two older siblings, April and Bobby, and Brenda's grandmother, known as Alice The Great. Each episode usually consists of two stories showing Little Bill's home life or at school, illustrating the usual goings-on of a five year old's life. At the end of the show, Little Bill usually addresses the audience, recapping what happened to him and what he learned that day, prompting one of his other family members to ask, "Little Bill, who are you talking to?" Note: Little Bill is loosely based on the life of creator Bill Cosby, who was most likely referred to as Little Bill as a child since his name is William Henry Cosby, Jr. In real life, however, Dr. Cosby is the oldest of four brothers, not the youngest of three children.

Andy and Opie live with Andy's Aunt Bee, who serves as a surrogate mother to both father and son.

                             <span class="plot" >The Eric André Show is a comedy television series on Cartoon Network's late night programing block, Adult Swim. It first aired May 20, 2012. The series is produced by Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim's production company Absolutely Productions.

The show is a parody of low-budget public access talk shows, hosted by Eric Andre and Hannibal Buress. André is a hyperactive and dysfunctional host who often stutters or otherwise fails to properly maintain his screen presence. He often overreacts during interviews, acts aggressively towards his crew members, diverts from the script and refuses to read the cue cards. The surreal attitude of the show is emphasized by "celebrity" guests that have nothing in common with the actual stars they purport to be except their announced names, although occasionally genuine celebrities do appear.

Besides the studio segments that are the main focus of the show, short sketches, candid camera footage and non sequiturs, usually focused on André's absurd behavior, are featured in the program.</span> <br />

Meanwhile, another priest finds himself locked in a life-and-death struggle with evil. Father Brennan is a modern-day Templar Knight and is everything Father Tomas is not: relentless, abrasive and utterly consumed by his sacred mission.

Caught in the middle is the Rance family. On the surface, they’re a normal, suburban family, but all is not as it seems. The patriarch, Henry Rance, is slowly but surely losing his mind. Eldest daughter Katherine has become a recluse and her younger sister, Casey, thinks she’s hearing strange noises coming from inside the walls. Mother Angela has been plagued by recurring nightmares. She believes there is something in the house, a demonic presence, growing stronger by the day. Desperate, she begs Father Tomas for help, unwittingly setting the naïve young priest on a collision course with Father Marcus. Separately, each faces an insurmountable task, but together they become the only hope against an evil force that has been mobilizing for centuries.</span> <br />

                             <span class="plot" >"The Fabric of the Cosmos," a four-hour series based on the book by renowned physicist and author Brian Greene, takes us to the frontiers of physics to see how scientists are piecing together the most complete picture yet of space, time, and the universe. With each step, audiences will discover that just beneath the surface of our everyday experience lies a world we’d hardly recognize—a startling world far stranger and more wondrous than anyone expected.

Brian Greene is going to let you in on a secret: We've all been deceived. Our perceptions of time and space have led us astray. Much of what we thought we knew about our universe—that the past has already happened and the future is yet to be, that space is just an empty void, that our universe is the only universe that exists—just might be wrong.

Interweaving provocative theories, experiments, and stories with crystal-clear explanations and imaginative metaphors like those that defined the groundbreaking and highly acclaimed series "The Elegant Universe," "The Fabric of the Cosmos" aims to be the most compelling, visual, and comprehensive picture of modern physics ever seen on television.</span> <br />

Each episode begins with a scene of Margaret appearing in dire circumstances — in season one, he is a defendant in a British court, with a long list of charges against him being read; in season two, he is in what appears to be a North Korean nuclear missile base, being forced to press a launch button — then flashes back to portray the events leading to his sad fate.</span> <br />

The IT Crowd is a playful and somewhat surreal look at what it's really like to be the underclass of every company - the IT Department.</span> <br />

The Killing ties together three distinct stories around a single murder including the detectives assigned to the case, the victim's grieving family, and the suspects. Set in Seattle, the story also explores local politics as it follows politicians connected to the case. As the series unfolds, it becomes clear that there are no accidents; everyone has a secret, and while the characters think they've moved on, their past isn't done with them.</span> <br />

Recalling Lamb's command as a military police officer during World War II, the Mayor appeals to his sense of duty to look into a murder of a casino worker -- and so begins Lamb's clash with Vincent Savino, a ruthless Chicago gangster who plans to make Vegas his own. Assisting Lamb in keeping Law And Order are his two deputies: his diplomatic, even-keeled brother Jack  and his charming but impulsive son, Dixon. Ambitious Assistant District Attorney Katherine O'Connell, who grew up on the ranch next to the Lambs, also lends a hand in preserving justice. In Vegas, two powerful men -- Lamb and Savino -- are engaged in a fierce battle for control of the budding oasis, and for both of them, folding is not an option.</span> <br />
