This harmless salutation is the least-controversial thing that comes out of Louis C.K.’s mouth as he turns rants on everyday subjects (impatient people, his weight, fatherhood) into hilarious, expletive-laden diatribes where nothing is sacred—not even (gasp!) his children. Who else can name-check Ray Charles and Adolph Hitler in the same breath and elicit a chorus of raucous laughter? Louis C.K. says what’s on his mind, even at the risk of offending, but his “I don’t give a f**k” attitude makes his irreverent brand of humor especially endearing and relatable. His self-deprecating style elevates his filmed live show to a form of therapy, where we, too, can get comic relief from some pretty warped subjects. At one point, Louis C.K. asks, “Where do you draw the line?” With him, there is no line.</span> <br />

Neville is the eccentric Munchausen, an aristocrat who relies on the power of his imagination - and a crackpot band of henchmen - to defend their city from plunder. Idle plays the loyal Berthold, the world's fastest man who runs all the way to Spain and back in under an hour to save the Baron's neck, and who hilariously outruns a speeding bullet! When Munchausen's not collaborating with his screwball associates, he can be found walking on air - literally - with the lusciously beautiful Venus (Thurman). Filmed by Oscar nominee cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno, with stunning special effects!</span> <br />

Building on Brand’s emergence as an activist following his 2014 book Revolution, where he railed against “corporate tyranny, ecological irresponsibility, and economic inequality,” The Emperor’s New Clothes pairs archival footage with comedic send-ups conducted in the financial centers of London and New York. Brand spotlights not only how the crisis affected the working class around the world, but also how the uber-wealthy benefited from the downturn. With Winterbottom providing his signature ingenuity and pinpoint directorial control, they generate a riveting, boisterous, and, at times, cathartic riff on the extreme disparities between the haves and have nots in contemporary society.</span> <br />

Bulger captures the sensational trial of infamous gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger, using the legal proceedings as a springboard to explore allegations of corruption within the highest levels of law enforcement.

Pulling back the curtain on long-held Bulger mythology, the film challenges conventional wisdom by detailing shocking, new allegations. With unprecedented access, Berlinger's latest crime documentary offers a universal tale of human frailty, opportunism, deception, and the often elusive nature of truth and justice.</span> <br />
